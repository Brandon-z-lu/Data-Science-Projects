- This project aims to investigate the association between proximity to train stations in Sydney and housing prices. The project involves web scrapping from a popular Australian property sales website, data cleaning, graphical and regression analysis.
- I built `0.0automated_if_check_loop_30min`, along with `0.1.get_suburbs.py`, `0.2.get_train_station_names`, and `0.3.if_analysis_works.py` to cross-match the suburb names with the train station names, reducing human manual data entry time by 8 hours.
- I built ` 1.Six-functions-for-data-processing.rmd` to automate data processing from the https://www.auhouseprices.com/sold/list/NSW/. I built a web scrapping function that extracts housing data, prices, and location from the website which was then processed into usable datasets.
- `2.Data-graphing.html` shows the graphical representation of the data from the code `2.Data-graphing.rmd`. The result includes scatter plots and box plots.

## 01. ECON 302 HW2ExploringModel (R, Graphical Analysis, Macroeconomic Analysis)

In this assignment, I drew real GDP, labour stock, and total working hours from the FRED (St. Louis Federal Reserve) [database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series) to plot the Solow residuals. I also examined the years required for Indonesia and Malaysia to catch up with Belgium's GDP per capita by using the neoclassical economic model and data from [Maddison data](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/?lang=en)

## 02. ECON 326 Final Project (R, Regression Analysis, Model Specification Check, Model Robustness Check, Report Writing)

**Result: obtained an 83% on this project**

In this assignment, I investigated the relationship between neighbourhood income levels and the number of cultural spaces in a disseminated area (DA is the fundamental unit of analysis in StatsCan data). I drew data from Statistics Canada and performed data point and DA matching. I further wrote a highly motivating literature summary of the current academic evidence on the subject. It is followed by regression analysis and model checks.

## 03. POLI 101 Final Paper final v (Policy Analysis, Research, Report Writing)

**Result: obtained a 97% on the final paper**

In this paper, I qualified the success of the senate reform of PM Justin Trudeau. I neatly synthesized four pages of well-researched  references and performed analysis on a range of viewpoints of his reform legacy.

## 04. Moot Court 2025 UBC (Legal Research on CanLii, Factum Writing)

**Result: placed No. 5 out of 19 teams**

In this moot court brief, I, alongside my co-counsel, Julia Pidutti, wrote the legal briefs on the side of plaintiff and defendant. This showcases excellent legal research, legal synthesis, and legal analysis.

## 05. BUSS 1000 Case Study on Blue Scope (Business Research, Report Writing)

I analyzed using the **Corporate Social Responsibility** (CSV) and **Porter's Five Forces** (P5F) framework.

## 06. BUSS 1000 OMO Presentation (Business Research, Report Writing)

I led a team of five, conducting **strategic diamond** analysis on the profitability of OMO, a laundry detergent brand, and gave concrete business recommendations.
